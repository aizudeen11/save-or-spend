# save-or-spend
if you have a loan with a bank. you might want to pay the bank more than your montly installment, probably because you want to pay less interest or to settle the loan faster or improve credit score. however we have another option. instead use the extra money in monthly loan installment, you might want to use it to invest in invesment account such as fixed deposit or EPF. 

but which option will you choose? to spend it and pay more in loan monthly installment or save it in investment account? 

this is the purpose of this program. it will calculate and compare your investment value (if you save it in investment account) and interest saving (if you pay more in monthly loan installment)
